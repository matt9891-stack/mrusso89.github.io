# <a id="about-me"></a>👋 About Me

I am a **Data Science student** at the University of Essex with a strong background in **retail management** and a growing passion for **data-driven decision-making**.

My journey into technology began in 2020 when I took my first **Excel** course to improve my analytical and forecasting skills. This led me to learn **SQL** and **Google Looker**, where I created interactive dashboards to track key performance indicators, department trends, and best-selling products.

Motivated by this, I joined a **Data Analytics Bootcamp**, strengthening my skills in **SQL, Python, and Tableau**. This experience provided me with the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support strategic business decisions.

Now, with a solid foundation in data analytics and hands-on experience in business operations and management, I am eager to start my career as a **Data Analyst**. I bring a combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and leadership experience ready to contribute effectively to any data-driven project.

### [BMI Calculator](https://github.com/matt9891-stack/Utilty_BMI.git)

In this project, I created two small utilities to calculate the **BMI (Body Mass Index)** and assign a class based on the value of the index.

* **Objective:** Compare the development process using two common programming languages: **Python** and **JavaScript**.
* **Python:** Used for its easy syntax, versatility, and wide application in data analysis, data science, and machine learning.
* **JavaScript:** Used to create a dynamic interface (running directly on the browser) and utilized with **Node.js** for running scripts outside the browser.
