# About me 

I am a Data Science student at the University of Essex with a strong background in retail management and a growing passion for data-driven decision-making.

My journey into the world of technology began in 2020, when I took my first Excel course to improve my analytical and forecasting skills. As I explored its potential, I realised the importance of having more efficient tools for sharing and analysing data. This curiosity led me to learn SQL and Google Looker, where I created interactive dashboards to track key performance indicators, department trends, and best-selling products in the stores I managed.

Motivated by my increasing interest in data, I later joined a Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I strengthened my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau. This experience provided me with the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can support strategic business decisions.

Now, with a solid foundation in data analytics and hands-on experience in both business operations and management, I am eager to start my career as a Data Analyst. I bring a combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and leadership experience that allows me to contribute effectively to any data-driven project.

## Projects

[BMI Calculator](https://github.com/matt9891-stack/Utilty_BMI.git) â€“ In this project, we have created two small utilities that calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) and assign a class based on the value of the index.

The two utilities have been developed using two of the most common programming languages, Python and JavaScript, with the final aim of comparing them.

Python is a programming language widely known and used for its easy syntax, as it uses English to develop its code, and its versatility and readability. It can support different programming styles such as procedural, object-oriented and functional and, thanks to its many different free libraries, it is widely used for data analysis, data science and machine learning.

JavaScript is a programming language used to create a dynamic interface on the website. It runs directly on the browser, but it can be used in any IDE such as VsCode by using Node.js, which is an open-source cross-platform which allows users to run JS scripts outside the browser.
