# About Me

I am a Data Science student at the University of Essex with a strong background in retail management and a growing passion for data-driven decision-making.

My journey into the world of technology began in 2020, when I took my first Excel course to improve my analytical and forecasting skills. As I explored its potential, I realised the importance of having more efficient tools for sharing and analysing data. This curiosity led me to learn SQL and Google Looker, creating interactive dashboards to track key performance indicators, department trends, and best-selling products in the stores I managed.

Motivated by my increasing interest in data, I later joined a Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I strengthened my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau. This experience provided me with the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can support strategic business decisions.

Now, with a solid foundation in data analytics and hands-on experience in both business operations and management, I am eager to start my career as a Data Analyst.
