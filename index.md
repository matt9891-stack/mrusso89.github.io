# About Me 

I am a Data Science student at the University of Essex with a strong background in retail management and a growing passion for data-driven decision-making.

My journey into technology began in 2020 with my first Excel course. Later, I learned SQL and Google Looker, creating interactive dashboards to track KPIs and store trends.

I also joined a Data Analytics Bootcamp, strengthening my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau, enabling me to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Now, with a solid foundation in analytics and management experience, I am eager to start my career as a Data Analyst.
