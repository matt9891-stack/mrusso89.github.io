# About me 
Student in Data Science at the University of Essex.

My journey into the world of technology began in 2020 when I first downloaded an Excel course to enhance my skills in analysis and forecasting. As I explored Excel's capabilities, I realised the need for a more efficient way to access and share data with my team. This led me to study SQL and Google Looker, where I developed dashboards that provided key insights into departmental trends and best sellers for the store I managed.

My passion for technology grew over the next two years, and I decided to deepen my expertise by enrolling in a data analytics boot camp. Here, I expanded my knowledge in SQL, Python, and Tableau, equipping myself with the tools necessary to turn data into actionable insights.

Now, with a solid foundation in data analytics and hands-on experience in retail business and management, I'm ready to embark on a career as a Data Analyst. I'm excited to apply my skills and continue learning in this ever-evolving field.

I possess a wide range of transferable skills that I can apply and continue to develop for any future project, drawing on my previous experience in management and retail.

## Projects

[BMI Calculator](https://github.com/matt9891-stack/Utilty_BMI.git) â€“ In this project, we have created two small utilities that calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) and assign a class based on the value of the index.

The two utilities have been developed using two of the most common programming languages, Python and JavaScript, with the final aim of comparing them.

Python is a programming language widely known and used for its easy syntax, as it uses English to develop its code, and its versatility and readability. It can support different programming styles such as procedural, object-oriented and functional and, thanks to its many different free libraries, it is widely used for data analysis, data science and machine learning.

JavaScript is a programming language used to create a dynamic interface on the website. It runs directly on the browser, but it can be used in any IDE such as VsCode by using Node.js, which is an open-source cross-platform which allows users to run JS scripts outside the browser.
